    title: "Can I track multiple groups or trips?",
    description:
      "Absolutely! As a Beta user, you can create as many groups as you like — whether it’s a ‘Japan Trip’ or ‘Housemates’. Tabby keeps everything neat, separate, and in sync 🧳🏠💸.",
  },

    title: "Can I change how Tabby categorizes stuff?",
    description:
      "Totally. If Tabby gets a category wrong or you just want to switch things up, you can easily reassign categories anytime using the settings command. Tabby learns from your preferences too.",

    title: "What gets synced to Notion?",

    description:
      "No worries! You can edit or delete any expense anytime. You’ll be able to update the description and category. For other changes, simply delete and re-add the expense. More flexibility coming your way soon — stay tuned for updates!",

    title: "How do I invite more people to share expenses?",

    title: "How many Notion templates do we offer?",
    description:
      "Three — and they’ve got you covered! One’s for your personal spending, another’s for epic group travels, and the last one handles everyday group expenses (think housemates or team lunches). Tabby picks the right one for you when you sign up — no guesswork needed. More templates are on the way, and soon, you’ll get to choose your favorite!",
